To compile and run the program:
TODO

To generate random sequences:
``python3 generate_random.py``
This creates (or overwrites, if they were created and written to previously)
five files in the current directory, rand_500.txt, rand_1000, etc., where
rand_500.txt has 10 pairs of 500-character-long randomized sequences,
rand_1000.txt has 10 pairs of 1000-character-long randomized sequences, etc.
